## 📝 Overview  
**Wheather-App** is a web application that provides real-time weather information from around the world.  
Using an external weather API, the app allows users to search for a city and view the current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and other relevant details.  
The goal of the project is to build a modern front-end application with clean UI/UX and ready for further expansion (forecasting, location tracking, etc.).

## 🧩 Features  
- 🔍 Search for a city name and retrieve current weather data.  
- 🌡️ Display temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather description and icon.  
- 📍 Optional: Auto-detect user’s location (if implemented).  
- 🎨 Clean and responsive UI design (works on desktop & mobile).  
- 🧠 Modular JavaScript code ready for more features (e.g., forecast, favouriting cities, offline mode).

🛠️ Technologies Used
Technology	Purpose
HTML5	Structure of the web page
CSS3	Styling and layout
JavaScript	Fetching weather data & UI logic
Weather API	External data source (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)

🔮 Future Enhancements
Here are some ideas you can build on:

Add weather forecast (3-5 days) instead of only current data.

Add geolocation so the app shows weather for user’s current location.

Add favourites list so user can save multiple cities.

Improve UI with animations or dynamic backgrounds (e.g., different images depending on weather).

Deploy the app (on GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel) so others can access it online.

### ✅ What to do next:
- Replace `screenshot.png` placeholder with an actual screenshot file (and ensure its path is correct).  
- Update the **Features** section with what your app actually does (if some features above are not yet implemented, mark them “Coming Soon”).  
- If you used a specific weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) mention the API in **Technologies Used**.  
- Add any extra sections (e.g., “How to Deploy”, “Credits”, “API Key Setup”) if applicable.

Would you like me to **customize the README further** by adding a “Live Demo” badge, deployment instructions (e.g., GitHub Pages or Netlify) and maybe a GIF preview of the app?
